# Generic/universal prototype PCB

This is a PCB layout I made for prototyping projects after I was unsatisfied
with any of the layouts one could buy "off the shelf".

## Features

* Three columns of DIP-friendly stripboard layout.
* Supports 600mil and 300mil DIP packages.
* Integrated ground and power rails on each column.
* Each column may have different power supply.
* Top and bottom ground/power rails.
* Support for up to 33x2 external 0.1" pitch connections.
